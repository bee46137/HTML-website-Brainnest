            <h4>Guitar:</h4>
            <p>
                I began learning the guitar a few weeks ago and am loving it! Hopefully
                I will be able to write my own songs one day.

            <h4>Classical Music:</h4>
            <p>
                I began to love classical music at the beginng of last year.  
                My favourite classical piece is "Winter" by Vivaldi.

        <div class="violin">
            <h4>Violin:</h4>
            <p>
                Because I love classical music, I bought a violin and will begin 
                learning how to play it within the next few weeks.
