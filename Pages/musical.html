                <h2>Guitar:</h2>
                <p>
                    I began learning the guitar a few weeks ago and am loving it! Hopefully
                    I will be able to write my own songs one day.

                <h2>Classical Music:</h2>
                <p>
                    I began to love classical music at the beginng of last year.  
                    My favourite classical piece is "Winter" by Vivaldi.

                <h2>Violin:</h2>
                <p>
                    Because I love classical music, I bought a violin and will begin 
                    learning how to play it within the next few weeks.
