            <h2>Reading:</h2>
            <p>
                My granny used to encourage me to read when I was young and I mostly read
                fiction back then. When I met my husband I began reading more philosophy and theology.
                I have loved reading poetry since high school and still enjoy reading poetry.

            <h2>Writing Poetry:</h2>
            <p>
                I loved reading and writing poetry in school. I still write poetry on the odd occassion
                and have recently sent one of my poems to be reviewed by a poetry journal called New Contrast! 
                If they like the poem they will publish it in their next issue.
